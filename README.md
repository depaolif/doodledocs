# DoodleDocs

DoodleDocs is a responsive, online drawing platform. It mimics a sketching program through the use of custom HTML Canvas methods that allow you to draw directly through the mouse. Individual strokes are saved in the history state of the sketching component, allowing users to see each step of the drawing, as well as permitting undo and redo functionality.

Users can also look through the latest doodles that other users have made, fork them, and add things to them or save them for himself/herself. Each new save keeps the history of previous versions, so users always have access to every stroke used to create an individual doodle.
